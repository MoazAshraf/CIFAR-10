# Training DNNs on CIFAR-10
Practicing model building and training in Keras on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Models
| Model                        	| Validation Accuracy 	|
|------------------------------	|---------------------	|
| 20 dense layers (ELU)       	| 44.3%               	|
| 20 dense layers + batch norm 	| 50.8%                	|
| 20 dense layers (SELU)        | 46.6%                 |
